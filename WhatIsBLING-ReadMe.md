I may *finally* have a working utility to make writing complex scripts in BASH easier.

I wrote this colorized preloader to automate sourcing (loading) files of different types with a single command.  

Gone are the days of manually sourcing half a dozen files by hand every time.  The PreLoader also ensures the directories and files to load are present before sourcing them.  

Once tested and completed, it will become part of a much larger project I have been working on, and also a key component of all future script development: BLING!

Oh, and for those who want to know what BLING is - I am not referring to a gold chain around the neck of a rapper LOL 😅 

BLING stands for: BASH Library Implementation - Next Gen.

What's a Library?
A library is a large piece of reusable code.  Why write the same commands 3,000 times when you can write it once and run it anywhere?  

Why Did I Create This Project?
Some command sets are a bit complex and difficult to memorize, especially when they need to be structured a certain way with multiple commands, brackets, senicolons, and formatting.  So I save those as functions.  Functions build libraries.  

An Analogy - Physical Books As Code
Think of BLING as a set of encyclopedias (physical ones before computers were in every home!).

Functions are like the pages in the books.
Libraries are like an entire book.
BLING seeks to be the complete set of encyclopedias comprised of several books (libraries). 

A New Challenger Has Appeared!
There are other BASH libraries out there, but I want to create my own.  I want it to be filled to the brim with useful features, be easy to install and use, and look good on Linux terminals everywhere!  

Obviously it will be open source 👍
