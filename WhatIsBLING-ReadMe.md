# What Is BLING?
A Primer On BASH Libraries
<hr>

  <h3> AdvPreLoader.sh - Coming Soon! </h3>
I may *finally* have a working utility to make writing complex scripts in BASH easier.

I wrote this colorized preloader to automate sourcing (loading) files of different types with a single command.  

Gone are the days of manually sourcing half a dozen files by hand every time.  The PreLoader also ensures the directories and files to load are present before sourcing them.  

Once tested and completed, it will become part of a much larger project I have been working on, and also a key component of all future script development: BLING!

Oh, and for those who want to know what BLING is - I am not referring to a gold chain around the neck of a rapper LOL 😅 

BLING stands for: BASH Library Implementation - Next Gen.

  <h3> What's a Library? </h3>
A library is a large piece of reusable code.  Why write the same commands 3,000 times when you can write it once and run it anywhere?  

<h3> Why Did I Create This Project? </h3>
Some command sets are a bit complex and difficult to memorize, especially when they need to be structured a certain way with multiple commands, brackets, senicolons, and formatting.  So I save those as functions.  Functions build libraries.  

<h3> An Analogy - Physical Books As Code </h3>
Think of BLING as a set of encyclopedias (physical ones before computers were in every home!).

-  Functions are like the pages in the books.
-  Libraries are like an entire book.
-  BLING seeks to be the complete set of encyclopedias comprised of several books (libraries). 

<h3> A New Challenger Has Appeared! </h3>
There are other BASH libraries out there, but I want to create my own.  I want it to be filled to the brim with useful features, be easy to install and use, and look good on Linux terminals everywhere!  

Obviously it will be open source 👍
