# BLING-Plugins (formerly tcs-scripts)
Misc. Scripts We Use - will become plugins for BLING

<div id="Warning">
<b>WARNING!  Highly experimental Projects Here!  Use At Your Own Risk.</b><br>
 <ul>
 <li> At this time, we are slowly building our library of scripts - all of which should be   
 considered experimental until further notice. </li>
 <li> They may work, or break your system, so we cannot take responsibility for recklessly running code without checking it first! </li>
 <li> The scripts will, over time, provide added benefits to Fedora users, and are listed here. </li>
 </ul>
