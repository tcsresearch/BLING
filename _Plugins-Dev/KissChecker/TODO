### TODO:###
#	Stop Program if not in built Kernel directory (SanityCheck_KBuildDir)

#	Needs to run with Kernel Makefile and copy of compiled vmlinux.
#		Should we include a Kernel Makefile?
#		Specify vmlinux via option/cmdline?  Running copy and/or rpmbuild based?

#	[IN PROGRESS] Split into functions/vars/configs etc.

#	Add Log By Date Capability (via $Today in BLING)

#	Add -a option to tee command as command line option?

#	Include cecho as library for fancy output.
#  	Use colorized output from cecho.

#	[PENDING] Configure where log files will be stored.

#	Should we grep for certain major flaws that could be exposed by the logfiles?
#		e.g. instead of scanning for x, tool can do it for us.
