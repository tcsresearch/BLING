To prevent the issue wherein running code fails to work but typing does,
Be sure to enclose variables in quotes.

Example:

```

## Define Variables ##
FuncFile="./UpdateRepo.bfunc"

# Check if the file exists and is a regular file
if [ ! -f "$FuncFile" ]; then
        echo " ERROR! Functions File $FuncFile Not Found.  Quitting..."
        exit 1
else
        echo "Sourcing Functions..."
        source "$FuncFile"
fi
```
