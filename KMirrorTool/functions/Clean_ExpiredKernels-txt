find is the common tool for this kind of task :

find ./my_dir -mtime +10 -type f -delete

EXPLANATIONS

    ./my_dir your directory (replace with your own)
    -mtime +10 older than 10 days
    -type f only files
    -delete no surprise. Remove it to test your find filter before executing the whole command

And take care that ./my_dir exists to avoid bad surprises !
