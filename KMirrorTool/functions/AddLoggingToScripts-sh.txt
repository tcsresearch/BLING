# The code adds a few things.

#    log files named with a timestamp
#    log folder specified
#    find looks for *.txt files only in the log folder
#    type f ensures you only deletes files
#    maxdepth 1 ensures you dont enter subfolders
#    log files older than 7 days are deleted ( assuming this is for a backup log)
#    notes the start / end time
#    calculates the elapsed time for the backup operation...
